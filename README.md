# OOSE2015: Carl, Malte & Rasmus - ASTEROIDS clone
A game project developed for the Object Oriented Software Engineering Class at AAU CPH 2015, Medialogy 4th semester. The game is developed as a clone of the classic Asteroids game. The gameplay mimics that of the original closely, however in this project an "overheat" feature is included. The "overheat" prevents the user from spamming the space with bullets, and thus adds an extra layer of difficulty and strategy to the gameplay.

The game is developed in Java using the Slick2D game engine. The graphics in the game is purely vector based, and the sounds are synthesised in the Studio One DAW.
